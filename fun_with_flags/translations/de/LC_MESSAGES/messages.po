"  <p><b>Purpose:</b> Fun with Flags allows you to automate capturing "
"flags on <a href=\"http://hattrick.org\" "
"target=\"_blank\">hattrick.org</a> if you are a nerdy supporter of the "
"infamous online-game like myself.</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p>The project was created out of frustration about having to click "
"around for a total of hours only to challenge the available maximum of 25"
" opponents for the friendlies every single week.</p>\n"
"  \n"
"  <p>FwF takes that burden of having to click through league after league"
" of you and lets you use your time for more valuable things.</p>\n"

"  <p><b>Zweck:</b> Fun with Flags erleichtert es dir, Flaggen auf <a "

" ich.</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p>Dieses Projekt ist aus dem Frust heraus entstanden, stundenlang "
"rumklicken zu müssen, nur um das verfügbare Maximum von 25 Gegnern für "
"ein Freundschaftsspiel  zu fordern, und dies jede Woche.</p>\n"
"  \n"
"  <p>FwF entlastet dich davon, Liga für Liga durchzuklicken, und  lässt "
